Disprove, prove, or estimate the truthfulness of the following statements related to the 1989 Belgian techno anthem "Pump Up The Jam".

1. Pump Up the Jam has a BPM (beats per minute) of 125, the same as the heartbeat of a cat at rest (you must estimate the BPM of a cat!).
2. This song is the national anthem of Canada.
3. The lyrics give clues to the location of a buried golden hare that has never been found.
4. Technotronic got their name by combining the word "techno", meaning a sort of dance music, and "tronic" meaning "tronic".
5. The original 12-inch release of "Pump Up The Jam" came with a free horse.
6. If you're going out can you get me a Coke Zero and a Twix?
7. Technotronic's home planet, Earth, consists of 70% water (use some estimation!).
8. If you isolate the individual drumbeats from this song and arrange them in a circle, it unlocks a cheat mode that allows you to pass through solid surfaces at will.
9. When the music video was first broadcast, audiences feared it was real, and that jam would be pumped into their homes through the screen. 
10. The barbarism of World War 1 inspired a wide range of harrowing war poems and pacifist literature, published decades before the release of unrelated Flemish techno anthem, “Pump Up The Jam”.
