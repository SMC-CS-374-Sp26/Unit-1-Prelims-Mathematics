# How to give a good presentation
DO: 
- Know your audience
	- What can you assume they know? Gloss over that.
	- What can you assume they don't know? Explain it clearly and as simply as possible.
	- **Ignorant Audience Law:** someone important in the audience always knows less than you think everyone should know, even if you take the Ignorant Audience Law into account.
- Keep in the time limit. Respect your audience members.
	- Rehearse your presentation so it does not go over time. 
- Talk with sufficient volume.
- Make eye contact and "read" the audience.
	- Change who you look at every once in a while.
- Dress appropriately for the occasion.
- Indicate somehow when your talk is over.
	- Ex. "Thank you. Are there any questions?"
- Decide what you want to say and say less than that.
- Use repetition to your benefit. A good portion of your audience at any given time will be thinking about something else.
- Use large font, >= 20 pt.
- Write reminders, key phrases, any math, somewhere as a note.
- **PRACTICE!** 
	- You will make mistakes the first time you present.
	- So, make the class time *not* the first time you present.
	- Time yourself with your phone's stopwatch.
- 
DON'T:
- Don't overload slides with details or information.
- Don't draw attention to people coming late.
- Don't point to your computer screen, point to the actual projected image.
- Don't put details in you don't plan to talk about.
- Don't put something in you're unsure of, unless you want to give the audience a chance to attack you.
- Don't run over time.
- Don't just *talk* about an important concept; put it on the slide.


# For Audience Members 

Concert Manners
- Arrive on time.
- Pay attention.
- Close your laptop and put away any technology.
- Come with a notebook.
	- write down anything interesting.
	- If nothing else, it will help you to stay awake.
- If you arrive late:
	- use the back door if possible
	- find a seat as quietly as you can, or stand to wait for the presenter to finish.
- If you must leave:
	- If possible, wait until the current presenter has finished.
	- Do so as quietly as possible if you cannot wait.


Final Tips
- Preparing a good talk takes time. Do not expect to throw one together at the last minute.
