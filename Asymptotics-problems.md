# Asymptotics Problems

1. Prove that $n^3 - 3n^2 - n + 1$ has a Big-Theta of $\Theta(n^3)$.
2. For each of the following functions, determine whether $g(n)$ is describing Big-O, Big-Omega, or Big-Theta of the function $f(n)$.

| $f(n)$ | $g(n)$ | Big-O, Big-Omega, Big-Theta? |
|---|---|---|
| $3n^2$ | $n^2$ | |
| $2n^4 - 3n^2 + 7$ | $n^5$ | |
| $log n$ | $log n + \frac{1}{n}$ | |
| $2^{k log n}$ | $n^k$ | |
| $2^n$ | $2^{2n}$ | |

2. Prove that the Big-O of $n^2$  is $O(2^n)$.
3. Prove or disprove: $\Theta(n^2) = \Theta(n^2+1)$.
4. [Re: 12 days of Christmas] Write an algorithm in high-level pseudocode (not actual code) that computes how many presents "I" receive, for $n$ days of Christmas. Compute its time-function, $T(n)$. Then state and prove its Big-Theta.
5. Is the Big-O of $2^{n+1}$ equal to $O(2^n)$?
6. Is the Big-O of $2^{2n}$ equal to $O(2^n)$?
7. Answer each question true or false, then prove your answer.
    1. The Big-O of $2n^2+1$ is $O(n^2)$.
    2. The Big-O of $\sqrt{n}$ is $O(log⁡ n)$.
    3. The Big-O of $log ⁡n$ is $O(\sqrt n)$.
    4. The Big-O of $n^2 (1+ \sqrt{n})$ is $O(n^2 log ⁡n)$.
